# Data Mining Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of core data mining algorithms written in Python. The goal of this project is to understand how common data mining algorithms work by implementing them from scratch and evaluating them on datasets.

## Content
- Hierarchical Clustering (single-link, complete-link, average-link)
- Decision Tree Classifier (entropy / information gain)
- Model Evaluation with k-fold cross-validation
